Because of the Hackathon, I really dont have much time to make the program cover all bad input situation,
so please follow those instructions to run the program:
  1): My input file format is: PlayerName1:(no space)Goals
                               PlayerName2:Goals
                               PlayerName3:Goals
                                        .
                                        .
                                        .
                                        etc
      Any other file format will not work
  2): In the Executive.cpp file, when you trying to insert a player with his record, please use the format:
      Player:(no space)Goals   for example I'm inserting myself, cin input will be:
        Enter the Record to be inserted:
        >Haonan:1997
        >Output:Record is successfully inserted
  I think that is all you should be careful with.
